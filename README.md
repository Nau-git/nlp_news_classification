## Welcome to my repository!

This is the repository for my NLP project where I made a model to classify news articles into four categories based on their title and description.

The notebook contains all of the works and the .py file is the script to deploy the model to the web (heroku).

The deployed model is available at https://nau-news-classifier.herokuapp.com/
